## Projects

Here is a selection of some of my projects that are publically available.


### Websites

#### Notrasmus.com - Personal Website
A website to show off my portfolio. It is currently work in progress and very barebones.

Available here: https://notrasmus.com


#### Gauss Eliminator

Used by many students for the [Linear Algebra](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/nmab10006u) course at University of Copenhagen.

The tool converts matrices to reduced row echelon form and gives you the output as LaTeX code.

Available here: https://gauss.notrasmus.com

Source code can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/GaussEliminator


#### Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A website that visualizes different sorting algorithms.

I made this visualizer to complement my high school SOP project about mathematical proofs and algorithms.

Available here: https://sorting.notrasmus.com

Source code can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/sortingalgovisualizer

The SOP project can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/SOPWorkspace


#### Inventory System

A system for logging where you keep your stuff. Can't remember where you put your keys? Enter it in the system and the next time you can't find them, you just need to look them up in the system!
Made as my high school exam project in Programming. Unfortunately the demo us currently not fully functional as the service I was using for hosting the backend is no longer available. However the backend can still be run locally if you are interested in trying out the full functionality.

Demo available here (missing basically all functionality): https://programmering.notrasmus.com

Front-end source code can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/eksamensprojekt-frontend

Back-end source code can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/eksamensprojekt-backend


### Games

#### Learning Game about Structure of Atoms

A game I made for my high school exam in Digital Design and Development using the Unity Game Engine. The game uses real-life data to correctly display every single isotope currently known. The objective of the game is to reach a certain atom by collecting electrons, protons and neutrons while trying to remain stable. You learn about neutrons, protons and electrons and how the correct balance between these is necessary to keep the atom stable. You also learn about orbitals and the different elements of the periodic table.

Source code and a build of the game can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/DDU-Eksamensprojekt


### Tools


#### Tweening Library for the Unity Game Engine

A tweening library for the Unity Game Engine, that makes programmatic animations significantly easier to make. I have used this tool in every game I have made after making this library.

Source code can be found at: https://github.com/Hjijijing/hjijijingtweening

#### URL Shortener

A small backend tool for implementing a URL shortener on your own custom domain name.

Source code can be found here: https://github.com/Hjijijing/urlshortener
